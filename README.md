Heart Disease Prediction Project
Project Overview
This project is a machine learning model designed to predict the presence of heart disease in patients based on a set of clinical and health-related features. The goal is to provide a tool that can assist in early risk assessment. The project was developed using Python and popular machine learning libraries like scikit-learn and pandas.

Key Features
Data Analysis: In-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset and identify key factors related to heart disease.

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the data, handling missing values, and transforming features for model readiness.

Model Building: Training and evaluating various machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, Logistic Regression) to find the most accurate predictor.

Interactive UI: A simple and user-friendly web interface built with Streamlit, allowing users to input their data and receive a real-time prediction.
